  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;"><strong>Last Updated: January 14, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>Cube ("we," "us," "our," or "Cube") is operated by <strong>96 AGENCY LTD</strong>, including the website, mobile applications, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Service.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By creating an account, making a payment, or using the Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. We may update these Terms at any time by posting the revised version on the Service. Your continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Cube is a private, invite-only lifestyle platform providing curated recreational experiences, live sessions, interactive activities, and engagement-based rewards. Participation in activities, live sessions, or reward programs is optional and intended for entertainment and engagement purposes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate, complete, and current information during registration and maintain it thereafter.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for all activity on your account and for maintaining login confidentiality.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms, suspicious activity, or legal compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Membership Credits – Nature, Allocation, and Redemption</h2>
    <p><strong>Membership credits</strong> (e.g., STRZ) are digital units used exclusively within the Cube platform.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purchased Credits</strong>: Payments made for membership or premium access are treated as prepaid amounts for future services. Credits may be redeemed for live sessions, events, or platform features.</li>
      <li><strong>Earned / Promotional Credits</strong>: Users may earn credits via engagement, participation in activities, or promotional campaigns. These are rewards for participation and have no cash value outside Cube.</li>
      <li><strong>Deferred Revenue</strong>: Payments for credits or memberships are treated as prepaid liabilities until services are delivered. Revenue is recognized only when services or experiences are provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Value and Use</strong>: Credits have internal platform value for redemption and do not represent cash outside Cube except as part of verified promotions.</li>
      <li><strong>Expiration and Forfeiture</strong>: Credits may be forfeited for inactivity exceeding 36 months or for violation of these Terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Refundable</strong>: Except as required by applicable law, payments for credits or memberships are non-refundable.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed securely via licensed providers (e.g., Paystack). All payments are final unless required by law. Memberships may be recurring until canceled. Prices exclude applicable taxes (e.g., VAT).</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some initial payments were processed as part of testing our live payment flow to ensure smooth operations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Rewards, Prizes & Engagement</h2>
    <p>Activities, live sessions, and engagement rewards are <strong>skill-based or participation-based promotional incentives</strong>, not chance-based gambling.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prizes (credits, event access, merchandise, or promotional rewards) are awarded at Cube's discretion and may be verified.</li>
      <li>Cash or other rewards, if offered, are subject to applicable taxes, which users are responsible for unless otherwise mandated.</li>
      <li>Referral and participation rewards are optional and are issued as credits or cash equivalents within Cube.</li>
      <li>Cube reserves the right to adjust, withhold, or cancel rewards for violations, fraud, or errors.</li>
      <li>No purchase is necessary to participate in free-entry promotional activities.</li>
    </ul>
