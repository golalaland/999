  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;"><strong>Last Updated: January 05, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>Cube ("we," "us," "our," or "Cube") operates the Cube platform, including the website, mobile applications, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Service.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By creating an account, making any payment, or using the Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. We may update these Terms at any time by posting the revised version on the Service. Your continued use after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Cube is a private, invite-only social entertainment platform offering curated hangouts, skill-based games (including TapMaster), moderated chat, live streaming, reward systems, and exclusive physical and virtual events. Participation in games, events, and rewards is entirely optional and for entertainment purposes only.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information during registration and maintain it thereafter.</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for all activity on your account and for keeping your login credentials confidential.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts at our sole discretion for any violation of these Terms, suspicious activity, or to comply with applicable law.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. STRZ Credits – Nature, Allocation, and Redemption</h2>
    <p><strong>STRZ</strong> are non-transferable, non-exchangeable digital credits issued solely for use within the Cube platform.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purchased STRZ</strong>: When you make a qualifying payment (e.g., ₦29,999), you receive a fixed allocation of STRZ (e.g., 3,000 STRZ). These represent prepaid credits for future access to Cube services, such as event invites or premium features.</li>
      <li><strong>Earned/Promotional STRZ</strong>: You may also receive free STRZ through daily logins (e.g., 100 STRZ per day), participation in polls, referrals, or performance in skill-based activities. These are promotional rewards with no cash value.</li>
      <li><strong>Value and Use</strong>: 1 STRZ has an approximate internal value of ₦10 for redemption purposes only. STRZ may be applied toward event access, unlocks, or other platform features. STRZ <strong>have no cash value outside the platform and are not redeemable for cash</strong> except where expressly offered as part of a specific promotion and subject to verification.</li>
      <li><strong>Deferred Nature</strong>: Payments for purchased STRZ are treated as prepaid amounts for future services. Cube recognizes revenue only when STRZ are redeemed for services (e.g., event attendance). Unredeemed STRZ remain a liability to Cube and do not constitute immediate income.</li>
      <li><strong>Expiration and Forfeiture</strong>: STRZ do not expire unless stated otherwise in a specific promotion. Cube reserves the right to forfeit STRZ for inactivity exceeding 36 months or for violations of these Terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Refundable</strong>: Except where required by applicable Nigerian consumer protection laws, payments for STRZ and subscriptions are non-refundable.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Access to premium features requires payment processed securely via licensed third-party providers (e.g., Paystack). All payments are final and non-refundable except as required by law. You authorize recurring charges until cancellation. Prices exclude applicable taxes (e.g., VAT), which may be added.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Rewards, Prizes & TapMaster</h2>
    <p>TapMaster and other activities are <strong>skill-based promotional contests</strong>, not games of chance. Outcomes depend on participant skill.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prizes (cash, STRZ, event access, or merchandise) are awarded at Cube's discretion and subject to verification.</li>
      <li>Cash prizes, if offered, are promotional rewards. Winners are solely responsible for any personal taxes (e.g., Personal Income Tax) on prizes received. Cube is not required to withhold or report such taxes unless mandated by law.</li>
      <li>Referral and team rewards (for girls/inviters) are promotional incentives payable in STRZ or cash at Cube's option.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to withhold, adjust, or cancel prizes for fraud, cheating, errors, or violations.</li>
      <li>No purchase is necessary to participate in free-entry promotional paths.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. User Conduct & Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engage in harassment, abuse, discrimination, or harmful behavior.</li>
      <li>Post illegal, explicit, defamatory, or offensive content.</li>
      <li>Cheat, use bots, exploits, or interfere with games or the Service.</li>
      <li>Attempt to manipulate rankings, referrals, or rewards fraudulently.</li>
      <li>Impersonate others or provide false information.</li>
      <li>Use the Service for commercial purposes without permission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We actively moderate content and activity. Violations may result in removal of content, forfeiture of STRZ/rewards, or account termination without refund.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All platform content, features, branding, and software (excluding user-generated content) are owned by Cube or its licensors and protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. You are granted a limited, non-transferable license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes only.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Privacy & Data Protection</h2>
    <p>Your personal data is processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA). We collect only necessary data for service delivery, rewards, and compliance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Cube, its affiliates, and personnel shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding any claim.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Cube harmless from any claims, losses, or damages arising from your violation of these Terms or use of the Service.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without cause or notice. Upon termination, unused STRZ and rewards may be forfeited.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>13. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of Lagos State, Nigeria. We encourage informal resolution first via support@cube.app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Severability</strong>: If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.</li>
      <li><strong>No Waiver</strong>: Failure to enforce any right does not constitute waiver.</li>
      <li><strong>Force Majeure</strong>: We are not liable for failures due to events beyond our control.</li>
      <li><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>: These Terms (with Privacy Policy) constitute the full agreement.</li>
    </ul>
